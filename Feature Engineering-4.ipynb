    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another, typically with the goal of making it suitable for storage, transmission, processing, or analysis. Data encoding is a fundamental concept in data science and has several important use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Categorical to Numeric Encoding: In many machine learning algorithms, data needs to be in a numeric format. Categorical variables, which represent categories or labels, often need to be encoded into numeric values. Common techniques for this include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "        One-Hot Encoding: This technique creates binary columns for each category in a categorical variable, allowing machine learning algorithms to work with categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Label Encoding: In label encoding, each category is assigned a unique integer label. It's suitable for ordinal categorical data, where there is an inherent order among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Ordinal Encoding: This is used when categories have an ordinal relationship, and you assign numeric values accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text Data Encoding: Natural language data (text) is often encoded into numerical vectors for use in machine learning models. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) are used to represent text data numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Scaling: In data preprocessing, features with different scales can affect the performance of machine learning algorithms. Encoding techniques such as Min-Max scaling or Z-score standardization are used to scale features to a common range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encoding Date and Time: Date and time data can be encoded into various formats like Unix timestamps, year-month-day (YMD) encoding, or cyclical encoding for use in predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Binary Encoding: Sometimes, data is encoded into binary format for efficient storage, transmission, and manipulation. For example, image and audio data are often stored and processed as binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Geospatial Encoding: Location data (longitude and latitude) can be encoded into various representations like geohashes or H3 indexes to facilitate spatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Encoding for Privacy and Security: Data may be encoded or encrypted to protect sensitive information during storage or transmission. Techniques like encryption and hashing are used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Encoding for Efficiency: Data encoding can be used to reduce storage requirements and improve data transfer efficiency. Techniques like run-length encoding and Huffman coding are examples of this."

    "Nominal encoding, also known as one-hot encoding, is a technique used in data preprocessing to convert categorical variables with nominal (unordered) categories into a numerical format that can be used in machine learning algorithms. Each category in the nominal variable is transformed into a binary (0 or 1) vector representation, where each category corresponds to a unique binary column. This encoding ensures that the model doesn't impose any ordinal relationship between the categories, which is essential for nominal data.\n",

    "    5           Fiber optic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Nominal Encoding (One-Hot Encoding): we'll apply one-hot encoding to the \"Internet Service Type\" column. Each category will become a new binary column.\n",

    "Create a new binary column for each category:\n",
    "\n",
    "DSL    Fiber optic  No internet service \n",

    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, is typically preferred over one-hot encoding in situations where the categorical variable has an inherent ordinal relationship among its categories. In other words, when the categories have a meaningful and ordered sequence, nominal encoding can be a more appropriate choice. Here's a practical example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: We are analyzing customer feedback for a product, and you have a categorical variable called \"Satisfaction Level\" with three ordinal categories: \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High.\" In this case, \"Low\" indicates lower satisfaction, \"Medium\" represents moderate satisfaction, and \"High\" represents high satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case for Nominal Encoding: In situations where there is a clear ordinal relationship between categories, nominal encoding can be preferred. We would assign integer values to the categories in a way that preserves this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Low\" -> 1\n",
    "\"Medium\" -> 2\n",

    "In this scenario, we have encoded the ordinal relationship between satisfaction levels, and it's meaningful to compare and analyze them numerically.

    "\n",
    "Use Cases for One-Hot Encoding (Not Preferred): On the other hand, one-hot encoding is typically preferred when there is no natural ordering or meaningful ordinal relationship between the categories. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables like \"Color\": If we have a categorical variable representing colors (e.g., \"Red,\" \"Green,\" \"Blue\"), one-hot encoding is the preferred choice because there's no inherent order or ranking among colors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an example using the \"Color\" variable:\n",

    "Scenario: We are analyzing the preference for product colors among customers. The \"Color\" variable has three categories: \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" and there is no inherent order among these colors.\n",
